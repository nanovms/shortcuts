# shortcuts
A collection of desktop shortcuts to easily run unikernels.

To run these you need to install OPS via https://ops.city.

Then simply copy an alias of these to your desktop.

You can change the cloud or config simply by editing:

(for example with redis):
```
Redis.app/Contents/Resources/config.json
```

Now you're double clicking on unikernels!
